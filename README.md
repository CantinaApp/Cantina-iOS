## Schema

### Models
We are not using a database through a service like Parse; instead we are storing all the data we need on the user's device.

#### Persistent Data on Device (UserDefaults)
Property | Type | Description 
---------|------|------------
`favorites` | `[String: Cocktail]` | a mapping of favorited cocktail ID's to their data (the data will only be present if offline storage is implemented; otherwise, it is just an array of IDs)
  
#### Cocktail Model
This is the model that will be used to parse information from the API. This model will also be used to store favorited cocktails if we implement the nice-to-have stories.

Property | Type | Description
---------|------|------------
`id` | `String` | id of the cocktail
`name` | `String` | name of the cocktail
`ingredients` | `[String: String]` | a mapping of cocktail ingredients to their measurements
`instructions` | `String` | a list of steps to make the cocktail
`glass` | `String` | the type of glass for serving the cocktail
`imageUrl` | `String` | a url for the image of the cocktail
`notes` | `String` | user created notes about the cocktail (nice-to-have)

### Networking
Because we are not using a database, we do not create any API calls to Parse or a server we made ourselves. Instead, we are receiving all data from an already-existing API, TheCocktailDB.
